Pending fixes:
(Severity: low) GPS NavFix may not contain the correct values. (However, the position is correct).
(Severity: low) roburoc4_driver does not contain the interface to the description service.
(Severity: med)	roburoc4_driver does not contain interface to setup the period of the different services (Make interface or include period as a parameter in launch file?)

Ideas:
Thought up 01/10/2012 by Rune M.:
Make the state estimator query every sensor of its variance.

Thought up 01/11/2012 by Rune M.:
Package improvements:
- aseta_sensors
 - more autonomous ( Find the correct device (and baud) automaticly)
 - gps_node
  - Setup the gps to output the correct format instead of relying on the correct setup has already been made!
 - magnetometer_node
  - Setup the magnetometer to output the correct format instead of relying on the correct setup has already been made!
  - Make a smarter way of making and storing calibration!
- roburoc4_state_estimator
  - Implement Sensor bias (gyro and magnetometer).
- roburoc4_driver
 - Indføre robusthed overfor manglende forbindelse (informer brugeren herom i stedet for intet at gøre!)
